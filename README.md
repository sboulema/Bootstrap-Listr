A replacement for default server indices, Bootstrap Listr beautifully displays folders and files in the browser. It is built upon the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icons, optionally [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) themes can be used.

*Watch a [live demo](https://idleberg.com/demo/Bootstrap-Listr-2/) (latest [alpha-version](https://idleberg.com/demo/Bootstrap-Listr-2.3-alpha)!)*

## Installation

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/idleberg/Bootstrap-Listr/releases/latest) or clone the repository.

## Building

We use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) tasks to configure and build your application. Make sure to have gulp installed globally as well as all local Node dependencies.

```bash
# Install Gulp (optional)
npm install -g gulp

# Install dependencies
yarn || npm install
```

You can now run the build script to create a clean copy of Bootstrap Listr:

```bash
# Concatenated assets
npm run build

# Individual assets
npm run build:http2
```

Alternatively, you can now run the individual Gulp tasks. See `gulp help` for a list of available tasks.

## Deployment

Deploy `build/` to your server. All files that should be accessible in the browser go into the `_public` folder (you can define a different folder in the `config.json`). Depending on your Apache settings, you might have to uncomment the `RewriteBase` setting in the `.htaccess` file (maybe add folder name after the slash.)

## Options

You can configure a number of settings in the file `config.json`:

* Optional columns for size, modified date, permissions
* Document icons
* File viewer for images, videos, audio, source code, PDF and HTML
* Search box to filter results
* Column sorting
* Responsive tables
* List of ignored files
* List of hidden files
* Default location for JavaScript libraries and style sheets (CDN or local)
* Syntax highlighting in file viewer
* Save to Dropbox
* Share buttons
* Google Analytics
* Language
* Virtual files
